      Enterprise Linux is a descriptor used by Linux distributions to highlight that they meet 
      the rigorous needs of large organizations or commercial environments. 
      The common characteristics shared by enterprise Linux distributions are stability, 
      security and compliance, interoperability, and support.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this guide, you can familiarize yourself with the features of enterprise Linux 
      distributions, in order to make informed choices about which is most suitable for you.
